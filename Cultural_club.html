	<p>The S.Co.P.E committee never ceases to amaze the college & keep the spirit of the campus lively with its pursuits. The team keeps coming up with ideas and executes them giving out the best results every year, leaving a trail of achievements each year to look up to. The year started with our orientation wherein our Principal, Dr. Hemlata Bagla’s words of sheer motivation drove the committee to work with such dedication.</p>
	<p>2019 has been a year of many first times for the S.Co.P.E family. We experimented with a new idea of “KC’s Next Icon”, a talent hunt show & establishing departmental “Societies” (Dance, Music, Drama, Literary and Fine Arts) within the team.</p>
	<p>S.Co.P.E fulfilled its lifelong dream of earning the first podium in Malhar (St. Xavier College) this year. KC Contingent bagged First podium in Shoutt (Jai Hind) and Second Podium in Tsunami (Lala College), making the year a grand success. The tremendous hard work of the societies reflected on the multiple departmental trophies we won. Team KC was the second runner up in the first season of HSNCB Performing Arts Festival.</p>
	<p>Annual day 2019-20 brought a lot of laurels to the Scope family. Ms. Riya Bhandari & Ms. Dalia Nouf Shaikh won the prestigious Title of MISS KC Degree & Junior respectively. Ms. Rhea Kanchan was presented the Rotary Trophy for outstanding student of the year. Last but not the least Cultural Director Ms. Neeta Dam was awarded KC PARASMANI (KC RATNA) in appreciation of years of devoted & dedicated services. Our Committee member Ms. Ashoi B Daantra represented India at 15th Mojiang Twins Cultural Festival (China) with her twin sister Anaushka & bagged the 4 th ranking Internationally.</p>
	<p>One major aspect of S.Co.P.E is annual cultural festival-Kiran. Kiran 2019 was a 4day long fiesta with departmental festivals – Joule, Blitzkrieg, Spectrum, Systematic Chaos and Fiestron under it’s umbrella. It was one of the best Kiran ever with a footfall of more than 10,000 with around 50 colleges competing with utmost glam and determination. Kiran manages to cross bigger and bigger milestones each year. S.Co.P.E also presented a series of grand Cultural performances at the Annual Day, Ms. Neha Hiranandani’s book release & the inaugural session of International Symposium on “Is Mahatma Gandhi possible?” We also arranged the meet & greet event with star cast of the blockbusters CHHICHHORE & SHIKARA.</p>
	<p>To conclude the year and reward ourselves for the achievements, S.Co.P.E organized a two-day fun filled trip to Igatpuri. S.Co.P.E is growing in terms of outreach as well as within itself and each year it has managed to grow and reach new heights. As the academic session 2019 ends, we look back upon our endeavors and hard work , hoping we come back, even stronger, to carry forward the legacy left behind. We have accustomed ourselves to look beyond the binaries this year and hope to reach a new horizon next year. Until next time!</p>
